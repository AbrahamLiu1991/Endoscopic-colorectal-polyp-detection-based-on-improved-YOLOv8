# Endoscopic-colorectal-polyp-detection-based-on-improved-YOLOv8
This repository includes Endoscopic colorectal polyp detection based on improved YOLOv8. We employ deformable Conv V2 and EMA modules to improve the YOLOv8 model, further achieving a significant performance improvement while maintaining the detection speed.
